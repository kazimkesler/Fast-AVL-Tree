# Fast-AVL-Tree
Non-Recursive implementation of AVL Tree

In C language, insertion operation for AVL Tree with enhanced perfomance as non-recursive

I didnt do implementation for delete operation because i think that delete operations on AVL tree requires high runtime overhead due to balancing an avl tree could requires several balancing operations.
