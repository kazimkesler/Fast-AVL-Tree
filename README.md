# Fast-AVL-Tree
Non-Recursive Implementation of AVL Tree

In C language, insertion operation for AVL Tree with enhanced perfomance as non-recursive

I didnt do a implementation for delete operation because i think that delete operations on AVL tree require high runtime overhead due to balancing an avl tree after the deletion could requires several balancing operations.
